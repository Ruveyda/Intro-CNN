*** Intro-CNN1 :

- Introduced neurons, the building blocks of neural networks.
- Used the sigmoid activation function in our neurons.
- Saw that neural networks are just neurons connected together.
- Created a dataset with Weight and Height as inputs (or features) and Gender as the output (or label).
- Learned about loss functions and the mean squared error (MSE) loss.
- Realized that training a network is just minimizing its loss.
- Used backpropagation to calculate partial derivatives.
- Used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to train our network.
